<h1>Using a <code>ch</code> unit to size text</h1>
<p> the <code>ch</code> unit allows you to control the size od text 
    based on its actual contextual size-the width of a <code>0</code>
    character.
    this maens that if you set the max width of some text as <code>70ch</code>: 
    regardles of the size of that text, you can always be sure that it will be at most,
    70 characters wide.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and change the font sizes and max width of these elements in the CSS 
        editor to see it working</p>
